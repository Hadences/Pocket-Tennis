# Tools/Lanaguage Used
1. GDScript
2. Godot Game Engine
3. Aseprite

# Challenges/What I Learned
1. Creating my own physics in order to develop the game from a top down perspective - Tennis Ball to specific
2. Screen Resolution should be set smaller than what it actually should be for pixel based games
3. Enemy AI decisions were made purely based on randomness rather than logical thinking
4. Difficulty scaling
 
# How to play
1. Just like tennis, the game rules should be the same - except for the deuce part (no deuce)
2. Hit the ball by left clicking and the ball will be hit in the direction the cursor is at
3. WASD to move
